## Shadowing
### You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, here we can say **the first one is shadowed by the second one.

```rs

// Only modify `assert_eq!` to make the `println!` work(print `42` in terminal)
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    {
        let x = 12;
        assert_eq!(x, 5);
    }

    assert_eq!(x, 12);

    let x =  42;
    println!("{}", x); // Prints "42".
}
```
# Solution:
```rs
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    {
        let x = 12;
        assert_eq!(x, 12);
    }

    assert_eq!(x, 5);

    let x =  42;
    println!("{}", x); // Prints "42".
}
```

# 6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
```rs

// Remove a line in the code to make it compile
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x = 7;
    // Shadowing and re-binding
    let x = x; 
    x += 3;

    let y = 4;
    // Shadowing
    let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; 

    println!("Success!");
}
```
# Solution:
```rs
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x = 7;
    // Shadowing and re-binding
    // let x = x; 
    x += 3;

    let y = 4;
    // Shadowing
    let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; 

    println!("Success!");
}
```
